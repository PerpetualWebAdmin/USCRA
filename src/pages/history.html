          <p>
            The Association started in summer 1985 when Registrars, Liaison
            Officers and a group of supportive staff from DECS IV Higher
            Education Division headed by Dr. Diosdada C. Boiser gathered in a
            scenic spot of Caliraya Lake in a resort owned by the Sobrepena’s
            where this body was formally organized. The association was then
            recognized as the Association of Registrars and Liaison Officers
            Region IV (ARLO R-IV).

            <br /><br />
            The main objective of the association is to maintain a strong
            network of institutions in Region IV in order to establish an
            effective, fastest and easiest way of sending and transmitting
            papers and other documents from DECS IV- HED to Higher Education
            Institutions in the Region. The association has been an effective
            network that has been supporting DECS IV- HED and its activities
            since then.
            <br /><br />

            The association became the avenue where the Registrars and Liaison
            Officers and other personnel of the Registrar’s Office come together
            to learn and discover the best practices in the Region. This is
            where the DECS IV- HED and later on the Commission on Higher
            Education in Region IV-A provides the member institutions with the
            updates on government issuances and memoranda. The association
            sponsors forums, trainings and seminars to its members and provides
            group activities to further enhance their working capabilities. The
            Registrars and Liaison Officers are always looking forward for the
            next forum, activities and assemblies of the association. The
            officers and its members have developed a strong camaraderie where
            each member felt a sense of belongingness.
            <br /><br />

            On May 9, 2001, the association was registered with the Securities
            and Exchange Commission and was named the “Association of School
            Registrars and Liaison Officers in Region IV” (ARSLO) with SEC
            Registration No. A200015235. However, with the implementation of
            Executive Order No. 103, dated May 17, 2002, where Region IV was
            split into two separate regions, Region IV-A (Calabarzon) and Region
            IV-B (Mimaropa) the association decided to give the original name
            ‘Association of Registrars and Liaison Officers Region IV” (ARLO
            RIV) to Region IV-B (Mimaropa).

            <br /><br />

            Region IV-A created a new name for the association and is now
            officially known as the “Association of College Registrars and
            Liaison Officers in Region IV-A Inc. (ACURLO RIV-A)”, registered
            with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 28, 2013 with
            Sec Registration No. CN201316597.

            <br /><br />
            One of the significant contributions of the association in the
            Region is the publication of the first Manual for School Registrars
            in 2009. It has become the source of information, and a tool that
            provides the Registrars and Liaison Officers with general
            information on policies, standards, and processes in the performance
            of their functions. The manual also contains relevant Memoranda and
            Circulars that serve as their reference in the overall school
            operations.
            <br /><br />
            With the intention of the association to introduce to the member
            schools the new trends on student records management, the Officers
            initiated series of forums and assemblies to come up with standard
            processes on major issues and concerns that are being faced by the
            Registrars and Liaison Officers. The first Handbook “ACURLO’s
            Handbook Vol. 1 ‘Output of Focus Group Discussion’ was produced and
            distributed last September 2016 to its member schools during its
            30th General Assembly in Baguio City.
            <br /><br />
            On the same occasion, the creation of the Admissions Officers
            Association in the Region was initiated by ACURLO. It was named
            University, College and School Admissions Officers Association R-IVA
            (USCA R-IVA). Its main objective is to establish admission policies
            and standards that would complement the policies and standards set
            by the ACURLO.
            <br /><br />
            The association continues to live by its vision and mission to serve
            and be an inspiration to the Region. It aspires to bring together
            the Registrars and Liaison Officers of Higher Education Institutions
            in Region IV as one family moving towards the realization of its
            ultimate objective of providing excellent services to its clients.

            <span>People</span> from other Regions wonder what the acronym ASRLO means. For
          some occasions the national organization could not fathom why in
          Southern Tagalog ASRLO was born.
          <br /><br> 
          More often than we realize, there are people in the organization
          that make decisions in the absence of the person in the position.
          This has been the observation of our own staff in the early days of
          Higher Education Division under the Department of Education, Culture
          and Sports, Region IV. At the time, almost fifty percent (50%) of
          our clients were liaison officers. The registrars of the school were
          either doing their functions in schools or they prefer to delegate
          the work of making submission and follow – up of papers in the
          Office. It was felt that the Liaison Officers and Registrars had a
          shared action wherein they were bound together around a common
          identity and sense of destiny to excel, learn and provide services
          to their clients. They possess a set of governing values by which
          they behave and regard their customers, community, and other publics
          as valuable components to their work. On that score it was observed
          further that the registrars and liaison officers were able to speak
          easier, to speak honestly or to reveal information on whatever
          agreed-upon values there were. The implications here were apparent
          for fostering the kind of supportive environment in which knowledge
          sharing flourished.
          <br /><br />
          It was such a significant summer of 1985 when a group of supportive
          staff from HED-DECS IV with registrars and liaison officers were
          gathered in a scenic spot of Caliraya Lake in a resort owned by the
          Sobrepena’s where this body was formally organized. There were a few
          officers who were very active that pursued the objectives of the
          said organization. With them, the job of sending and transmitting
          paper and other documents were made much easier and pleasantries of
          both the service agency and the institutions being served had been
          fruitful. From then on, the organization guided most administrators
          on what they want from the regulatory agencies.
          <br /><br />
          This was the simple and significant development of the organization
          of ASRLO R-IV which is now Association of College and University
          Registrars and Liaison Officers, Region IV-A (ACURLO RIV-A).
