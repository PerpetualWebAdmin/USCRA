          <p>
            The Association started in summer 1985 when Registrars, Liaison
            Officers and a group of supportive staff from DECS IV Higher
            Education Division headed by Dr. Diosdada C. Boiser gathered in a
            scenic spot of Caliraya Lake in a resort owned by the Sobrepena’s
            where this body was formally organized. The association was then
            recognized as the Association of Registrars and Liaison Officers
            Region IV (ARLO R-IV). <br /><br />The main objective of the
            association is to maintain a strong network of institutions in
            Region IV in order to establish an effective, fastest and easiest
            way of sending and transmitting papers and other documents from DECS
            IV- HED to Higher Education Institutions in the Region. The
            association has been an effective network that has been supporting
            DECS IV- HED and its activities since then. <br /><br />The
            association became the avenue where the Registrars and Liaison
            Officers and other personnel of the Registrar’s Office come together
            to learn and discover the best practices in the Region. This is
            where the DECS IV- HED and later on the Commission on Higher
            Education in Region IV-A provides the member institutions with the
            updates on government issuances and memoranda. The association
            sponsors forums, trainings and seminars to its members and provides
            group activities to further enhance their working capabilities. The
            Registrars and Liaison Officers are always looking forward for the
            next forum, activities and assemblies of the association. The
            officers and its members have developed a strong camaraderie where
            each member felt a sense of belongingness.

            <br /><br />On May 9, 2001, the association was registered with the
            Securities and Exchange Commission and was named the “Association of
            School Registrars and Liaison Officers in Region IV” (ARSLO) with
            SEC Registration No. A200015235. However, with the implementation of
            Executive Order No. 103, dated May 17, 2002, where Region IV was
            split into two separate regions, Region IV-A (Calabarzon) and Region
            IV-B (Mimaropa) the association decided to give the original name
            ‘Association of Registrars and Liaison Officers Region IV” (ARLO
            RIV) to Region IV-B (Mimaropa). <br /><br />Region IV-A created a
            new name for the association and is now officially known as the
            “Association of College Registrars and Liaison Officers in Region
            IV-A Inc. (ACURLO RIV-A)”, registered with the Securities and
            Exchange Commission on August 28, 2013 with Sec Registration No.
            CN201316597.

          <p>
            <span>One</span> of the significant contributions of the association
            in the Region is the publication of the first Manual for School
            Registrars in 2009. It has become the source of information, and a
            tool that provides the Registrars and Liaison Officers with general
            information on policies, standards, and processes in the performance
            of their functions. The manual also contains relevant Memoranda and
            Circulars that serve as their reference in the overall school
            operations.

            <br /><br />With the intention of the association to introduce to
            the member schools the new trends on student records management, the
            Officers initiated series of forums and assemblies to come up with
            standard processes on major issues and concerns that are being faced
            by the Registrars and Liaison Officers. The first Handbook “ACURLO’s
            Handbook Vol. 1 ‘Output of Focus Group Discussion’ was produced and
            distributed last September 2016 to its member schools during its
            30th General Assembly in Baguio City.

            <br /><br />On the same occasion, the creation of the Admissions
            Officers Association in the Region was initiated by ACURLO. It was
            named University, College and School Admissions Officers Association
            R-IVA (USCA R-IVA). Its main objective is to establish admission
            policies and standards that would complement the policies and
            standards set by the ACURLO.

            <br /><br />During its 5th Registrars' Forum held at the University
            of Perpetual Help System - Laguna in Binan City on December 6, 2018,
            ACURLO RIV-A, Inc. launched the ACURLO PLUS - Promoting Love, Unity,
            and Service. The ACURLO PLUS program aimed to a) provide
            opportunities for ACURLO members to raise their awareness on social
            consciousness, responsibility, and involvement; b) provide avenue to
            share one’s time, talent, expertise, and resources to help improve
            the quality of work life of its members and targeted beneficiaries;
            and c) promote and strengthen camaraderie and volunteerism among its
            members.

            <br /><br />The Laguna Cluster conducted the first ACURLO PLUS
            project, with Bahay ni Maria in Calamba, a home for abandoned
            elderly people with special needs, as its first recipient. Two
            ACURLO PLUS projects were completed successfully in 2019. The Quezon
            Cluster organized a gift-giving event at Sinag Kalinga in Lucban,
            Quezon. Sinag Kalinga is a non-profit organization that provides
            hospice care to impoverished and abandoned elders. Another project
            is a free training course for newly appointed registrars with the
            theme, “Relearning the Basics of Registrarship,” which was held on
            May 8, 2019, at De La Salle Lipa.

            <br /><br />In its desire to improve the performances of the
            Registrars’ offices in Region IVA and be at par with the quality of
            services being provided by its counterparts abroad, the ACURLO in
            2018 and 2019, conducted benchmarking activities in some of the
            prestigious universities in Thailand and Taiwan.

            <br /><br />In the recent conventions and fora organized by the
            association, a number of participants were from outside of Region
            IVa. This motivated the ACURLO to dream big to expand the
            association’s membership. Thus, in 2019, during its 33rd Annual
            Regional Convention held in Boracay, Aklan the new name of the
            association was launched.

            <br /><br />The association’s new name became University, College,
            and School Registrars Association (UCSRA), Inc. The new name was
            registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission with SEC
            Registration No. CN201955206. The association continues to live by
            its vision and mission to serve and be an inspiration to the Region.
            It aspires to bring together the registrars and records personnel of
            universities, colleges, and schools as one family moving towards the
            realization of its ultimate objective of providing excellent
            services to its clients.
